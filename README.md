# NootLang++ üêßüêßüêß
The future of programming is here. Finally, a programming language every Pingu can understand!
NootLang++ is the most inefficient language ever created by a human. **Bask in its glory:**

## Examples
### Hello World
based on brainfuck hello world from wikipedia

### Other Examples
NootLang++ is incredibly easy to pick up thanks to our wide array of fabulous examples with excellent documentation!

## Features

### Commands
NootLang++ is based on NootLang, and as such, is extremely readable and very simple. If you don't get it, you're basically just an idiot.

```lua
nooT	-- Increments the data pointer
Noot	-- Decrements the data pointer
noOT	-- Increments the data at the current cell
NOot	-- Decrements the data at the current cell
NOOt	-- Starts a while loop (while [data at pointer] ~= 0 do)
nOOT	-- Ends a while loop (end)
nOot	-- Divide data[dp + 1] by data[dp + 2] and store the result in data[dp]
noOt	-- Multiply data[dp + 1] by data[dp + 2] and store the result in data[dp]
NooT	-- bitwise or data[dp + 1] by data[dp + 2] and store the result in data[dp]
nOOt	-- bitwise and data[dp + 1] by data[dp + 2] and store the result in data[dp]
noot	-- Prints the current character at the pointer
NoOt	-- Reads a byte from the currently-open file and store it at the data pointer.
NoOT	-- Writes the byte at the data pointer to the currently-opened file.
NOoT	-- Prints an ASCII-ART penguin and exits the program.
NOOT	-- If no file is open, make a string containing data[dp] chars starting from data[dp + 1] and open the file at that path. (The data pointer ends up at the end of the string)
		-- Otherwise, close the currently open file.
```

### Type Safe?
Types are too confusing to Pingus, so NootLang++ doesn't bother with them at all!
Everything is just a "number." You could technically store a float* at the current cell being pointed to. Or a byte. Signed/Unsigned. It doesn't matter!**

*Floats doesn't exist
**Except when you go to read/write.

### Extremely well-written interpreter
There's definitely no bugs here! Totally solid.

### "What about bit-shifting or accepting input from the console"?
We worked very hard to create this monumental achievement in human history*, and we don't think asking for features is very respectful. It'll be there in NootLang++(Not this NootLang++), just be patient!
In the meantime, just accept input from files and manipulate all of your values manually using addition/subtraction/multiplication/division???

* woke up with a hangover and... apparently I wrote this?

### Is it turing-complete?
come again?
